## Motivation 

Have you ever encountered being in a dilemma when you are trading on the stock market? Have you ever dumped your shares due to the fear of incurring greater losses? Those who trade, especially day traders and short-term traders, often find themselves in such a position where they tussle between logic and emotion. 

Often we let our emotions take over our logical evaluation of the market. Such an occurrence prevents us from maximising our profits and minimising our losses. Implementing a trading bot will ensure that we fully rely on technical analysis to decide on what transactions to be carried out. This bot will help individuals make the decision to buy or sell shares based on an algorithm.

## Aim 

The aim of the trading bot is to maximize traders’ profits and create a hassle-free platform where users can easily access information about their shares. 

## User Stories

- As a working individual and part-time trader, I am able to trade without having to constantly monitor the stock prices and fluctuations.
- As a person who constantly trades based on emotions, I am able to better trade my stocks without having to constantly worry about the stock market volatility.
- I am able to easily track key details regarding my stocks (e.g. News, Margins)
